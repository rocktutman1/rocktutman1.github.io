    <h4><strong>#1 If I would I could</strong></h4>
    <p>Dave Blunts is such a criminally underrated rapper, like I don’t even know where to start. 
        His flow is smooth as hell but still gritty, the kind of crud that sticks in your head after one listen. 
        The wordplay and storytelling are raw as funk, and honestly, some of his songs hit me so hard they felt like they pulled me out of a dark place. 
        It sounds crazy, but the way he raps about struggle and growth legit felt like he spiritually saved me. 
        It’s bullhonkey how little recognition he gets when his music has that kind of impact.</p>
